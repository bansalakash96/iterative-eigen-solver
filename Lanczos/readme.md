Lanczos method is often used for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large
sparse symmetric matrices in areas such as quantum mechanics, signal processing,
and machine learning. The method is named after Cornelius Lanczos who introduced
it in 1950s. This method is particularly used when working with very large matrices that
are difficult to store explicitly, and when only a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to
be computed. Similar to the power algorithm, it relies heavily on computing matrix-vector
products.
