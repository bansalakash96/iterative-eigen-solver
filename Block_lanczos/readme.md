Block Lanczos algorithm can be very helpful in order to handle the issue of loss of
orthogonality of Lanczos vectors involved in the conventional Lanczos method. This method
starts with a block of random vectors and the emergence of spurious
eigenvalues can be delayed as one keep on using more random vectors in the starting block.
Since the algorithm can be used for obtaining more number of Lanczos vectors. Hence, more
eigenpairs can be captured.
